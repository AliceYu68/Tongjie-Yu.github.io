title: "APLUS"
excerpt: "Our report focuses on a cloud computing service called APLUS. As a start-up, APLUS has limited funding for cloud services. Cloud services, on the other hand, are what we desperately need. Therefore, APLUS needs cloud services that are reasonably priced and cost effective. According to the service platform provided by APLUS, we conducted research and comparison, and found that amazon website service is cheaper than Google cloud platform. AWS and GCP have many common services, but they offer different pricing models for customers. Our research covered a number of issues related to AWS and GCP's price, value, and storage space. The conclusion of this study proves that our hypothesis is wrong and helps APLUS company play a significant role in choosing cloud service platforms." <br/>
