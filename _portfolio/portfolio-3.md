title: "APLUS"
excerpt: "Our report focuses on a cloud computing service called APLUS. 
As a start-up, APLUS has limited funding for cloud services. For cloud services, what we desperately need.
Therefore, APLUS needs cloud services that are reasonably priced and cost effective.
We conducted research and comparison, found that amazon website service is cheaper than Google cloud platform.
AWS and GCP have many common services, but they offer different pricing models for customers.
Our research covered a number of issues related to AWS and GCP's price, value, and storage space.
This study proves that our hypothesis is wrong.
APLUS company play a significant role in choosing cloud service platforms." <br/>
