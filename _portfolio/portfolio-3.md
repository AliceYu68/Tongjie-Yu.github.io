excerpt: "Our report focuses on a cloud computing service called APLUS. <br>
As a start-up, APLUS has limited funding for cloud services. For cloud services, what we desperately need.<br>
Therefore, APLUS needs cloud services that are reasonably priced and cost effective. <br>
We conducted research and comparison, found that amazon website service is cheaper than Google cloud platform. <br>
AWS and GCP have many common services, but they offer different pricing models for customers.<br>
Our research covered a number of issues related to AWS and GCP's price, value, and storage space. <br>
This study proves that our hypothesis is wrong.<br> 
APLUS company play a significant role in choosing cloud service platforms." <br/>
